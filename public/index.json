Welcome to my webpage! My name is Nur Zulaiha Jomhari. You can call me Nuha or Nur. I am from Malaysia and has been working and living in Hamburg, Germany since 2017. Therefore, I am a permanent resident of Germany. I did my Ph.D. in experimental particle physics (CMS experiment) at DESY Hamburg with University Hamburg and PIER. Most of the time I did data analysis in physics other than supervised students. I want to build a career in the data science field. I like to attend programming workshops to improve my skills and work on mini-projects during my free time :)\nInterview as an alumni of PIER Helmholtz Graduate School: [link]\nAchievement certificates # Coursera course: What is Data Science # Workshop on developing a career with Python # Workshop on data analysis and visualization with Python # Transcript of records of my PhD activities # Gave a PhD seminar to other students # Basic Python course # ","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"About me # Hi everyone!","title":""},{"content":" Data Science projects. # This page will contain Data Science projects that I did during courses, bootcamps and free time # ** Currently joining data science training (3 months) by neuefische.

The datasets used for this validation analysis are only partially overlapping with the one used in the Higgs discovery paper [link]. This validation analysis aims to give an example of using CMS Open Data for educational applications and show the potential of its usage for research applications. The analysis is presented in four different levels of difficulties. More details about this project including the example code is publicly released in this [link]. The example is also adapted for GitHub, kindly provided by Freya Blekman [link]. I also gave a presentation at DPG 2018 where the slides are publicly accessible [link].\nMany people have benefited from this example on the usage of CMS Open Data [link1] [link2]. Even now, I am contacted by students who use my example as reference for their projects. I am really happy to answer those questions, hoping that it is useful and they learn something from it.\nSince I have used CMS Open Data for many projects, I would like to talk a bit more about it below.\nCMS Open Data # CMS Open Data [link] are original data used by CMS members that are released to the public via the CERN Open Data portal [link]. CMS Open Data can not only be used for research but also for educational purposes.\nEducational applications usually target school pupils and university students to provide knowledge about high energy physics in a fun and educational way without any prior knowledge. Research applications focus on people who want to conduct and publish their analysis using the original preserved data. To achieve both purposes, several example codes of different analyses are available in the portal for users to analyze.\nFigure below shows the official CMS plot for the \u0026ldquo;Higgs to four leptons\u0026rdquo; channel, shown on the day of the Higgs discovery announcement (left) and a similar plot using CMS Open Data (right).

Measurement of Total and Differential Charm Cross Sections at 7 TeV with the CMS Detector # This is my main Ph.D. project :)\nThe project presents the total charm cross section measurement in the full kinematic phase space of proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It was performed using open data (2010) from the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV due to its special low transverse momentum (pT) tracking. This is the first and so far only measurement of charm 7 TeV in CMS.\nMotivation of This Work # Particle physics is one of the physics fields that allow the study of matter at its fundamental level. The theory that describes the elementary particles and their interaction is referred to as the Standard Model. Exploring the particles within the Standard Model is interesting because there are still many aspects that are not fully understood. In addition, experimental measurements are important as they may reveal deviations that point to physics beyond the Standard Model.\nFigure above shows the Standard Model of particle physics. This picture is taken from [here]. It\u0026rsquo;s cute, right? ;)\nIn this work, a study on a particle called charm quark is conducted. The interaction of charm quarks, like any other quarks, is mainly governed by a part of the Standard Model called Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The measurement of charm production thus provides a way to test QCD predictions. These can then be used to further constrain the charm quark mass, the proton parton density functions, and other QCD parameters.\nFigure above shows the phase space in transverse momentum vs rapidity in which different LHC experiments performed their measurements of charm quark production so far. The analyses mentioned in this figure are: ALICE [link1] [link2] [link3], LHCb [link1] [link2] [link3], ATLAS [link1], CMS 5 TeV [link1], HIN [link1], and CMS 13 TeV [link1]. As in the present analysis, these analyses measured D mesons or other charm hadrons. Some of these measurements were extrapolated to the full kinematic phase space with a large extrapolation factor in order to extract the total charm cross section. The corresponding total cross section values are thus strongly theory/model dependent. This analysis aims to cover the largest possible fraction of the total phase space in order to extract the total charm cross section with the smallest possible extrapolation, and thus smaller theoretical uncertainty.\nD∗ Reconstruction # The charm reconstruction was done through the D\u0026lowast;\u0026plusmn; \u0026rarr; K\u0026mnplus;\u0026pi;\u0026plusmn;\u0026pi;\u0026plusmn; final state, where K refers to kaon and \u0026pi; refers to pion. A sketch of D\u0026lowast; decay is illustrated below. A sketch above shows primary D∗ decays to D0πs where D0 decays to Kπ in the xy plane. In reality, the curve of πs is more like a helix curve. The subscript s on πs is because the pion is commonly referred to as the \u0026ldquo;slow\u0026rdquo; pion due to the small difference between the D∗ and D0 masses (just above the pion mass). This leads to a slow pion momentum and thus a highly curved track, giving D∗ events a distinctive signature. Analysis Strategy: Pileup as a Physics Resource # In classical approach, a low pT charm analysis can be performed using Zero Bias and Minimum Bias triggers only, since no dedicated triggers are available for charm production. However, in this analysis, statistics is a limiting factor. Even though the cross section of charm in pp collision is high, these triggers, unfortunately were heavily prescaled. Therefore, the strategy is to use also pileup vertices as they can recover untriggered charm events.\nThe source of pileup vertices comes from the events triggered by non-Zero Bias and non-Minimum Bias triggers on any suitable datasets. In this case, muon and electron datasets are used since the muon and electron detector deposits which fire the trigger can be uniquely associated to a particular vertex which can then be excluded. Only purely leptonic triggers in these datasets are used.\nResult # This analysis has covered the largest possible kinematic phase space at the LHC from a single experiment with pT down to 1 GeV. This includes three new phase space regions where no D* cross section measurement has been done before at the LHC for pT below 3.5 GeV. The total charm cross section is then extracted from this analysis. By combining with the LHCb measurements, which covered most of the region outside the CMS detector coverage, and some extrapolations from Monte Carlo Pythia and FONLL, the total charm cross section for the full kinematic phase space is measured to be 9.40 ± 0.45 (statistical) with uncertainty of +2.5 and −0.95 (FONLL/Pythia) mb with an extrapolation factor of 1.4 throughout all phase space. This is the smallest extrapolation achieved for the total charm cross section at the LHC so far.\nFigure above shows prompt D∗± double differential cross section as a function of pT in |y| bins. The last bin is the overflow bin. More details about this project is documented in my thesis. It is publicly accessible via CERN [link], DESY [link] and University of Hamburg [link] publication databases.\n","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/ph-projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"PhD projects.","title":""},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"Here is a list of projects that I did throughout my career.\n","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"Here is a list of projects that I did throughout my career.","title":"Projects"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
