## Higgs to Four Leptons with CMS Open Data
This is my first project during my Ph.D. where I reproduced the Higgs to four leptons analysis with CMS Open Data. The datasets used for this validation analysis are only partially overlapping with the one used in the Higgs discovery paper [[link]](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1207.7235). This validation analysis aims to give an example of using CMS Open Data for educational applications and show the potential of its usage for research applications. The analysis is presented in four different levels of difficulties. More details about this project including the example code is publicly released in this [[link]](https://opendata.cern.ch/record/5500). The example is also adapted for GitHub, kindly provided by Freya Blekman [[link]](https://github.com/cms-opendata-analyses/HiggsExample20112012). I also gave a presentation at DPG 2018 where the slides are publicly accessible [[link]](https://cms.desy.de/sites/sites_desygroups/sites_extern/site_cms/content/e78437/e83421/e85075/e142142/e89447/e120786/DPG2.pdf).

 Many people have benefited from this example on the usage of CMS Open Data[[link1]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-018-0342-2) [[link2]](https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/abs/2021/05/epjconf_chep2021_01004/epjconf_chep2021_01004.html). Even now, I am contacted by students who use my example as reference for their projects. I am really happy to answer those questions, hoping that it is useful and they learn something from it. 

 Since I have used CMS Open Data [[link]](https://opendata.cern.ch/docs/about-cms) for many projects, I would like to talk a bit more about it below. 

### CMS Open Data
CMS Open Data are original data used by CMS members that are released to the public via the CERN Open Data portal [[link]](https://opendata.cern.ch/docs/about). CMS Open Data can not only be used for research but also for educational purposes. 

Educational applications usually target school pupils and university students to provide knowledge about high energy physics in a fun and educational way without any prior knowledge. Research applications focus on people who want to conduct and publish their analysis using the original preserved data. To achieve both purposes, several example codes of different analyses are available in the portal for users to analyze. 

Figure below shows the official CMS plot for the "Higgs to four leptons" channel, shown on the day of the Higgs discovery announcement (left) and a similar plot using CMS Open Data (right).
