## About me
Hi everyone! Welcome to my webpage! My name is Nur Zulaiha Jomhari. You can call me Nuha or Nur. I am from Malaysia and has been working and living in Hamburg, Germany since 2017. Therefore, I am a permanent resident of Germany. I did my Ph.D. in experimental particle physics (CMS experiment) at DESY Hamburg with University Hamburg and PIER. Most of the time I did data analysis in physics other than supervised students. I want to build a career in the data science field. I like to attend programming workshops to improve my skills and work on mini-projects during my free time :)
