Hi everyone! Welcome to my webpage! My name is Nur Zulaiha Jomhari. People can call me Nuha or Nur. I am from Malaysia and has been working and living in Hamburg, Germany since 2017. I did my Ph.D. in experimental particle physics (CMS experiment) at DESY Hamburg with University Hamburg and PIER partnerships. I want to build a career in industry and if possible in data science field. I like to attend some programming workshops to improve my skills and during my free time, I work on mini-projects. I'm still in the state of improving my webpage to make it interesting. Stay tuned! ;)
